            I am Binh (Cindy) Lam, a Third-Culture Kid, born in Vietnam and ethnically Chinese. 
            <br>I want to become part
            of the team as
            a Full Stack Web Developer. 
            <br> I have been growing up with the emerging web development industry and have
            always
            been interested in it.
            <br>
            <br> In the past year, before I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor’s degree in
            Communication,
            <br> I was grateful to contribute back to the Pitt community by taking on two jobs simultaneously. 
            <br>I was a media
            consultant at the Language Media Center and a Resident Assistant at the Residence Hall.
            <br>
            <br> I enjoy not only direct communication between people, but also visual communication that influences on
            different
            users and audiences. 
            <br> What attracts me to the Full Stack Developer role is the ability to bridge the
            connection
            between clients’ needs and users' wants.
            <br>
            <br> In order to advance my coding skills, I attend UPENN LPS Coding Bootcamp. 
            <br> This opportunity allows me
            to
            showcase my passion in coding and strengthened all the Front-End coding languages, 
            <br> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
            various CSS libraries, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars
            <br> some Back-End coding using APIs, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize. 
            <br> In the meantime,
            I have built up some professional portfolios.
